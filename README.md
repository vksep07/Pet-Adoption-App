# Pet-Adoption-App
The Pet Adoption App is a mobile application developed with Flutter that allows users to browse a variety of adoptable pets, view detailed information about each pet, and adopt their favorite pets. The app features a search bar, pagination, interactive pet details, and the ability to maintain the adoption state across app sessions, ensuring that once a pet is adopted, it cannot be adopted again.
